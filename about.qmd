# About Me

I'm a data scientist working on applied ML and AI systems, currently based in Montréal.
I enjoy building robust, practical solutions and increasingly reflecting on how data and AI are used
to support meaningful, real-world decisions.


## How I approach problems

I care a lot about:

- Understanding the context behind the data before modeling
- Building solutions that are robust, interpretable, and useful in practice
- Communicating uncertainty, limitations, and trade-offs clearly
- Writing clean, reproducible code and documenting decisions  
- Thinking beyond model performance to consider downstream usage and impact


## What I work on
 
- Building end-to-end data pipelines, from raw data to deployed machine learning systems  
- Designing and evaluating generative AI systems, including LLM-based and retrieval-augmented approaches, for practical use cases
- Communicating results and recommendations clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders  
- Contributing to projects where data supports decision-making at scale


## Tools & technologies

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Data & Machine Learning**: pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- **LLM-based systems**: retrieval-augmented generation, LangChain  
- **MLOps & Infrastructure**: Docker, Git, cloud-based workflows (GCP, AWS)  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
