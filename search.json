I enjoy building robust, practical solutions and increasingly reflecting on how data and AI are used to support meaningful, real-world decisions.\n\n\nI care a lot about:\n\nUnderstanding the context behind the data before modeling\nBuilding solutions that are robust, interpretable, and useful in practice\nCommunicating uncertainty, limitations, and trade-offs clearly\nWriting clean, reproducible code and documenting decisions\n\nThinking beyond model performance to consider downstream usage and impact\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding end-to-end data pipelines, from raw data to deployed machine learning systems\n\nDesigning and evaluating generative AI systems, including LLM-based and retrieval-augmented approaches, for practical use cases\nCommunicating results and recommendations clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\nContributing to projects where data supports decision-making at scale\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages: Python, SQL\n\nData & Machine Learning: pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch\n\nLLM-based systems: retrieval-augmented generation, LangChain\n\nMLOps & Infrastructure: Docker, Git, cloud-based workflows (GCP, AWS)\n\nVisualization: matplotlib, seaborn\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about my background and experience?
