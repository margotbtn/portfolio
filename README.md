## ✨ About this project

This repository contains the source code of my personal data science portfolio website.

The goal is to:
- Present projects in a clear and accessible way
- Showcase both technical skills and applied problem-solving
- Serve as a central hub linking demos, notebooks, and research-oriented work

The website is built with **Quarto** and automatically deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

- **Quarto** – static website generation
- **R / Python** – data science & analysis
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD for automatic deployment
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting
- **Docker** – reproducible local development environment
